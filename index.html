     <p> My career goals include having an healthy work-life balance 
    where I can enjoy things that are meaningful to me outside of work 
    while feeling fulfilled in my career. Additionally, I want to start off in somethign entry level 
    like data entry or an junior analyst position so I can fully understand what companies expect
     from data analysts and what an day-to-dat eould look like for my field.  </p1>
